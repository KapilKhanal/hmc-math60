\emph{Conservative} vector fields are just \emph{gradient} vector fields. To say
that some function \(\vec F\) is a gradient field is to say that there is some
\(f\) such that \(\vec F = \nabla f\).

Notice that the integral of a gradient vector field along a curve \(C\) is thus
the \emph{change} in the potential function across the endpoints of the curve:
\[
    \int_C \vec F \cdot \diff \vec s = \int_C (\nabla f) \cdot \diff \vec s =
    \int_C \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} \, \diff x_i + \dots\right) =
    \int_C \diff f = f(\vec b) - f(\vec a),
\]
where \(\vec b, \vec a\) are the endpoints of the curve \(C\).

\paragraph{Example}

Not all vector fields are gradient vector fields! Consider the field \(\vec
F\colon \real^2 \to \real^2 = (-y, x)\), integrated from point \(P\) to point
\(Q\) along two different paths \(C_1\) and \(C_2\):
\begin{center}
  \input{non-conservative.tikz}
\end{center}
Based on the geometry, we notice that the field is perpendicular to the
\(x\)-axis everywhere along the \(x\)-axis, so that the integral

% -y, x plot
% c1 is flat diameter path
% c2 is circular semi above horizontal path
% both left to right
% difference is given by green's theorem
Then consider the curve \(C = C_1 \cup (-C_2)\), so that \(C\) is the boundary
of the semicircular region \(D\). Then by Green's theorem
\[
    \oint_{\partial D = C} \vec F \cdot \diff \vec s = \iint_D
    \left(\frac{\partial N}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial M}{\partial y}\right)
    \diff A,
\]
where \(\vec F(x, y) = (M(x, y), N(x, y))\). Specifically

In general, these two different \emph{path integrals} are not equal. Vector
fields are typically not conservative.

But when are they equal? Notice by Green's theorem that a closed-curve path
integral in a curve like this is zero iff
\[
    \frac{\partial N}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial M}{\partial y}.
\]
Geometrically, notice then that this condition means that the vector field has
no ``rotation'' in the plane.

But also notice that, the reverse implication
\[
    \text{\(\vec F\) is conservative} \impliedby \frac{\partial N}{\partial x} -
    \frac{\partial M}{\partial y} = 0
\]
only holds when \(D\) is ``simply-connected'' (there are no ``holes'' in \(D\)).

\section*{Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals}

If path \(C\) starts at point \(A\), ends at point \(B\), and \(\vec F = \nabla
f\), then
\[
    \int_C \vec F \cdot \diff \vec s = f(B) - f(A).
\]
Notice that if \(F\) is conservative, the integral over the curve depends
\emph{only} on the endpoints, not on the path taken!

\paragraph{Example}

Consider the vector field \(\vec F = (2x, 2y)\). Calculate the path integral
over \(C\), a straight line from \((1, 1)\) to \((4, 3)\).

We can compute the integral by parametrizing the curve and integrating over the
parametrized curve. Let \((x, y) = (1+3t, 1+2t), 0 \le t \le 1\), so that the
integral becomes
\begin{align*}
  \int_C \vec F \cdot \diff \vec s &= \int_0^1 2(1+3t, 1+2t) \cdot (3,2)\, \diff t \\
  &= \int_0^1 2(5+13t) \, \diff t
  &= \left.\frac{1}{13} \, (5+13t)^2\right\rvert_0^1
  &= \frac{1}{13} \, (18^2 - 5^2)
  &= \frac{1}{13} \, (18-5)(18+5)
  &= 23.
\end{align*}


We can also compute the integral by evaluating the ``change'' in the potential
function \(f = x^2 + y^2\):
\begin{gather*}
  \int_C \vec F \cdot \diff \vec s = f(4, 3) - f(1, 1) =
  (4^2 + 3^2) - (1^2 + 1^2)
  = 23.
\end{gather*}

Wow, can't believe that the theorem is true! It essentially comes down to this
rough simplification---recall the \emph{total differential} of a function:
\begin{gather*}
  \diff f(x_1, \dots, x_n) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1} \, \diff x_1
  + \dots + \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_n} \, \diff x_n.
\end{gather*}
Then the line integral of a conservative field \(\vec F = \nabla f\) is just
\begin{gather*}
  \int_C \vec F \cdot \diff \vec s =
  \int_C (\nabla f) \cdot \diff \vec s =
  \int_C \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}, \dots\right) \cdot (\diff x_i, \dots) =
  \int_C \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} \, \diff x_i + \dots\right) =
  \int_C \diff f.
\end{gather*}




\section*{Flux}

The flux is a double integral of a vector field over a surface:
\[
    \iint_S \vec F \cdot \diff \vec S
\]
where \(\diff \vec S\) is some sort of a differential \emph{area} vector (a
vector normal to the surface with differential area \(|\diff \vec S|\)).
