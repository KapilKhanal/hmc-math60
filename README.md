# HMC Math 60: Multivariable Calculus (Fall 2017)

Lecture notes from section 2, courtesy of the fantastic Prof. Gu

# Work in progress?

Yes. These notes are a work-in-progress. I take them in class, push them here,
and continually (read: when I'm not lazy) update them over days to weeks after
the lecture. Consequently, these notes (especially recent ones) are most likely
incomplete.

If you see something misleading or blatantly wrong in my notes, please feel free
to call me out on my lies and deceptions by [opening an issue
report](issue). That'll make it easier for me to correct my unscrupulous
behavior.

# Urgency?

Because exams are coming up, and I'm somewhat behind on notes, you might need
something urgently that I haven't written up yet. Feel free to email me if you'd
like me to prioritize notes from a certain day so I can get to those first.

# Notes directory

Here's a list of notes. Notes marked with asterisks (*) are notes I consider
incomplete. (Notes not marked are ones I consider complete.)

# Python and TikZ

The more curious ones among you may wonder how I generate these wild 3d diagrams
and surface plots. The more attentive may notice, upon inspecting the source
code, that I ~~sold my soul~~ use a Python library named `tikz`. I made (or
rather am making) it. [Check it out!](tikz)

# `...tex` doesn't compile!

Probably. I paid no attention to backwards-compatibility; I'm barely even caught
up with these notes! File an [issue report](issue), or fix it for me. Thanks.

# Your TeX sucks!

Yeah, yeah. Whatever. Pull request me if you want to do something about it.

# Your Python sucks!

Oh, uh... oops.
